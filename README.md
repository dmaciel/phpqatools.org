This website used to be a list, curated by [Sebastian Bergmann](https://sebastian-bergmann.de/), of quality assurance tools for PHP.

This website has been superseded by a community-curated list of static analysis tools for PHP at [exakat/php-static-analysis-tools](https://github.com/exakat/php-static-analysis-tools) on GitHub.

If you need support with the selection and adoption of suitable tools to improve your PHP development process then [thePHP.cc](https://thephp.cc/implementation/tools) can help you.
